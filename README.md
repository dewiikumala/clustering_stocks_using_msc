# Clustering IDX80 stocks using Mean Shift Clustering 
Mean shift clustering is a type of non-parametric unsupervised learning algorithm used to group data based on similar characteristics without using cluster assumptions as the first step for clustering. Using this algorithm, IDX80 stocks will be clustered based on on return, expected return, and standard deviation and furthermore all cluster will be construct as portfolio efficiency using mean-variance method.
