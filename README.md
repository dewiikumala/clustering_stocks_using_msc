This project is dedicated to clustering IDX80 stocks using mean shift clustering based on return, expected return, and standard deviation. The dataset used are stocks that are consistently listed on IDX80 during the period January 1, 2020 - November 10, 2022. Historical stock data is obtained through the yahoo finance website. The expected return value, variance, and average trading volume of each stock are calculated and used as input for mean shift clustering. The objectives of this project are:

1. Clustering IDX80 based on 3 variabel using mean shift clustering
2. Construct an efficiency portfolio for each cluster using mean-variance method

Through this project, it is expected to be able to helps investors to get the maximum profit from the portfolio formed, also readers know how to apply mean shift clustering to group stocks based on predetermined variables.
